Astable Multivibrator Using IC 741:-

In this repositary I would like to share my experience while making an Astable Multivibrator using IC741, with its simulation and practical working. I have made this project during my First year of Electronics engineering.

📌 Components

*IC 741
*Resistors (Feedback + Timing)
*Capacitor
*Dual power supply (±12V/±15V)
*Breadboard & wires

📌 Working

* The 741 op-amp is used in 'comparator mode' with positive feedback.
* A capacitor connected to the inverting input charges and discharges through a resistor.
* The output switches between +Vsat and -Vsat of IC741.
* This repeated switching generates a square wave, while the capacitor voltage forms a triangular wave.
* The red LED blinks at one phase of output wave and white LED at opposite phase of output wave.
* The frequency of output wave can be altered by changing values of C and R.

📌 Output

Square wave at op-amp output

📌 Applications

* Clock generation
* Pulse generation
* Timing circuits

I have attached its circuit diagram, simulation video and practical working with it.
